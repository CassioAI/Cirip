    "We are working on a project to color grayscale pictures.\n",
    "The first few aspect of our project that we would like to introduce in this short introduction, are the decisions we took in our current approach to the problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Dataset:\n",
    "At first we were planning on using the ImageNet Database, but soon it became evident, that due to some technical difficulties on the site we weren't going to get access, so we decided on our current Database (Open Images V4 Dataset) which granted us the original images in a zip file. The images are not restricted to a single subject, the dataset incorporates images with various themes. We decided to start with 100000 images.\n",
    "(https://www.figure-eight.com/dataset/open-images-annotated-with-bounding-boxes/)\n",
    "\n",
    "The Images:\n",
    "Although the Images in the Database were mostly satisfactory for our goals, there were some modifications we had to make on them. Since the images were too big for us to handle and they did not have the same measurements we decided to crop them into a square shape and scale them down to resolution of 128X128. Also some of the pictures were not appropriate for our task such as grayscale pictures, so we decided, to sort them out.\n",
    "\n",
    "The LAB color scale:\n",
    "We decided to convert the images from RGB color space to LAB, which hopefully will make the teaching easier, as the L channel of LAB colorspace is the greyscale representation of the image, so the machine will only have to predict two channels instead of 3.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Small Parts:\n",
    "Even with a 128X128 scaling the whole dataset is too big to be loaded to the operating memory as a numpy array, so we decided to divide it into smaller parts, and teach the neural network on each smaller part individually."
